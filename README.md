# DSHConsole
A simple customizable DebugConsole for Unreal Engine! Made (almost) entirely in Blueprints!

This plugin was made for internal use in DashoGames and also for PiozaLauncher project, for easier debugging and testing.

### WARNING
I currently do NOT provide any support or docs for this plugin.
This repository is public to facilitate the development of PiozaLauncher via a separate submodule.
